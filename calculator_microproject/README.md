# Microproject - Calculator

The Calculator program is a simple implementation of a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It includes the following features:

1. **Logo Display:**

   - Displays an ASCII art logo using the `art` library.

2. **Mathematical Operations:**

   - Defines four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Stores these operations in a dictionary for easy access.

3. **Calculator Function:**

   - Defines a function `calculator` to handle user interactions.
   - Takes user input for the first number and displays the available operations.
   - Continues to prompt the user for an operation and the next number.
   - Performs the selected operation and displays the result.
   - Asks the user if they want to continue with the result or start a new calculation.
   - Recursively calls the `calculator` function for a new calculation.

4. **User Interaction Loop:**

   - Utilizes a `while` loop for continuous user interaction.
   - Takes the first number as input and displays available operations.
   - Prompts the user for the operation and the next number.
   - Performs the calculation and checks if the user wants to continue.

5. **Continue or Start Over:**
   - Asks the user to continue with the result or start a new calculation.
   - Recursively starts a new calculation if the user chooses to start over.

The code is well-documented, and the calculator provides a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations.
