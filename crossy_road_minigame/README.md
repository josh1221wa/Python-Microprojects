# Minigame - Crossy Road

This Crossy Road Minigame is a simple Python game where a turtle (player) competes against cars (AI) to reach the finish line. The game uses the Turtle graphics library for visualization.

## Introduction

The Turtle Race Game is a fun and interactive game where the player controls a turtle and tries to avoid colliding with cars while crossing the finish line.

## Gameplay

- The player controls the turtle using the "Up" arrow key to move upward.
- Cars move from right to left on the screen, and the player must avoid colliding with them.
- The game speeds up as the player crosses the finish line, increasing the difficulty.
- The game ends if the turtle collides with a car, and the final score is displayed.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that initializes the game, handles user input, and manages the game loop.
- `car_manager.py`: Defines the CarManager class responsible for managing the cars' movement, appearance, and speed.
- `player.py`: Defines the Player class representing the user-controlled turtle.
- `scoreboard.py`: Defines the Scoreboard class responsible for displaying the player's level and handling game over scenarios.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the game:

- **Python 3:** The programming language used to write the game.
- **Turtle Graphics Library:** A Python library for creating simple graphics and games.

## Program Flow

1. The `main.py` script initializes the game, including the screen, player, car manager, and scoreboard.
2. The player controls the turtle's movement using the "Up" arrow key.
3. Cars are generated by the car manager and move from right to left.
4. The game speeds up as the player crosses the finish line, increasing the difficulty.
5. If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.
6. The player can restart the game after a collision, and the speed and score increase with each successful round.

## Conclusion

The Turtle Race Game is a delightful project that demonstrates the use of Python and the Turtle graphics library to create a simple yet entertaining game. Feel free to explore the code and customize it to enhance or modify the gaming experience according to your preferences.
